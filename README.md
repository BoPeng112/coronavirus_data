Data and processing for coronavirus project. 

Please update this README when adding any new files. 

Main data files are in data/. 
combined_binarized_sars.csv is our main training data, with 1 for the 1102 positives and 0 for the 300K negatives. This combines the three AID datasets.
The test sets we want to predict on for now are broad_repurposing_library.csv, external_library.csv (the 866 molecules that Robert Malone sent us), and expanded_external_library.csv (the ~2500 molecules that Robert Malone sent us afterward, which don't seem to be a superset of the previous). 

316_corona_preds/ contains the most recent model predictions on each of the 3 test sets using the model trained only in AID1706. Will be moved to old/ and replaced by newer predictions once we have them for the model trained on the three combined AID dataset. 

conversions/ contains files for converting between smiles/cid/name. Obtained from https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/idexchange/idexchange.cgi

similarity_computations/ contains the nearest neighbor computations from each test set to the training set. 

scripts/ contains various processing scripts for reuse/reproducibility.

plots/ contains tsne plots of data distributions from different sets. statistics/ contains some numerical stats. 

splits/ contains some cross-validation splits for the combined_binarized_sars.csv file. These are generated by scripts/create_crossval_splits.py in chemprop: https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop/blob/master/scripts/create_crossval_splits.py. There are 5 splits for each of random and scaffold, generated by making 5 folds and then picking 1 test fold and 1 val fold for each split. These are splits for model benchmarking purposes. When training a model for prediction of compounds to test in the lab, you should make sure to use the full data and not withhold extra data for testing. 

raw_data/ contains miscellaneous raw data files. 
old/ contains older versions of files from when we only used AID1706 and not the rest of the data.
