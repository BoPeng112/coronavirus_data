Data for coronavirus project. 

Main data files are in data/. 
binarized_sars.csv is our main training data, with 1 for the 400 positives and 0 for the 300K negatives. 
The two test sets we want to predict on for now are broad_repurposing_library.csv and external_library.csv (the 866 molecules that Robert Malone sent us). 

raw_data/ contains the original raw data files and format conversions.
