# Data and scripts for coronavirus project. 

# Please update this README when adding any new files. 

## data/
- `AID1706_binarized_sars.csv` is our main training data, with 1 for the 400 positives and 0 for the 300K negatives. 
- the test sets we want to predict on for now are:
  - `broad_repurposing_library.csv`, `external_library.csv` (the 866 molecules that Robert Malone sent us)
  - `expanded_external_library.csv` (the ~2500 molecules that Robert Malone sent us afterward, which don't seem to be a superset of the previous).
- `corona_literature.csv` and `corona_literature_idex.csv` contain FDA-approved drugs that have been studied in the (generic) coronavirus literature. These are not guaranteed to be effective against any targets; they simply appear in the literature. 
  - `corona_literature.csv` was generated through direct name matches at https://www.cureffi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/drugs.txt
  - `corona_literature_idex.csv` was generated through the PubChem idex service and may contain multiple SMILES for generic drug names. 
  - `evaluation_set_v2.csv` is the combination of the broad repurposing library with Robert Malone's 60 reference actives, with those present in the training data removed. Reference actives are labeled as 1 while the broad library is labeled as 0. 

# 316_AID1706_preds/ 
The most recent model predictions on each of the 3 test sets using the model trained on only the AID1706 dataset. Predictions using 5-model chemprop ensemble with no hyperparameter opt at the moment. For reference, benchmarking non-ensembled versions of this model on scaffold split (5 folds) gets 0.8383 +/- 0.0283 AUC. This model got .963 AUC on evaluation_set_v2.csv. 

# conversions/
Files for converting between smiles/cid/name. Obtained from https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/idexchange/idexchange.cgi

# similarity_computations/ 
The nearest neighbor computations from each test set to the training set. 

# scripts/ 
Various processing scripts for reuse/reproducibility.

# plots/ and statistics/ 
tsne plots of data distributions from different sets and some numerical stats about the data. 

# AID1706_splits.zip
Cross-validation splits for the combined_binarized_sars.csv file. These are generated by scripts/create_crossval_splits.py in chemprop: https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop/blob/master/scripts/create_crossval_splits.py. There are 5 splits for each of random and scaffold, generated by making 5 folds and then picking 1 test fold and 1 val fold for each split. These are splits for model benchmarking purposes. When training a model for prediction of compounds to test in the lab, you should make sure to use the full data and not withhold extra data for testing.

Original raw data files and format conversions. 

# old/
Older versions of files from when we combined AID1706 data with other data that was unhelpful.
