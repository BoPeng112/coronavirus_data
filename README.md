Data for coronavirus project. 

Main data files are in data/. 
binarized_sars.csv is our main training data, with 1 for the 400 positives and 0 for the 300K negatives. 
The test sets we want to predict on for now are broad_repurposing_library.csv, external_library.csv (the 866 molecules that Robert Malone sent us), and expanded_external_library.csv (the ~2500 molecules that Robert Malone sent us afterward, which don't seem to be a superset of the previous). 

raw_data/ contains the original raw data files and format conversions. 

splits/ contains some cross-validation splits for the binarized_sars.csv file. These are generated by scripts/create_crossval_splits.py in chemprop: https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop/blob/master/scripts/create_crossval_splits.py. There are 5 splits for each of random and scaffold, generated by making 5 folds and then picking 1 test fold and 1 val fold for each split. These are splits for model benchmarking purposes. When training a model for prediction of compounds to test in the lab, you should make sure to use the full data and not withhold extra data for testing.
